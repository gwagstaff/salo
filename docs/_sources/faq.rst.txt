- **What is SALO?**

  SALO, or Sythentic Adversarial Log Objects, is a framework to generate log events without the 
  need for specific software, services, infrastructure, or resources. It allows for a simple and
  repeatable method to generate log events that would otherwise be difficult, time consuming, or
  even impossible to generate.
